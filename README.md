# Block-based Principal Component Analysis Pooling for Image Classification
This repository was created for the paper ... (link to paper) and contains the code for the experiments.
Our goal is to provide a simple and easy to use implementation of the proposed method.

## Installation
The code was tested with Python 3.6.9 and Tensorflow 2.12.0.
To install the required packages run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
The code is structured based on the Jupiter notebooks in the `notebooks` folder.

The notebooks contain the code for the experiments and can be run directly.

The `scripts` folder contains the implementation of the proposed method and the baseline methods.
